# Analysis of a deep transcriptomic atlas of the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease

This repository contains code and data to reproduce all main figures and analysis in the manuscript.

## Data

R data files:

- seurat object with raw gene expression data ("sn_atlas_unprocessed.RData")
- seurat object with processed data (cell type and cell subtype clusters, "sn_atlas_processed.RData")


## Analyses

- Cell type annotation using data integration analysis
- Analysis of changes in cell type proportions between cases and controls
- Cell type-specific DEGs between cases and controls
- Pathway and network analysis
- Pseudotime analysis to identify disease progression transcriptomic axis
- Cell-cell communication analysis
- Splicing analysis
- DaN subtype (AGTR1+) analysis
